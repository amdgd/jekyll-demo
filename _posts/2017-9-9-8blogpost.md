title: Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him Jeff

You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Annihilate? No. No violence. __I won't stand for it.__ *Not now, not ever, do you understand me?!* I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

## I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

You've swallowed a planet! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

1. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.
2. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!
3. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

### You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

* I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.
* No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.
* Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!

Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! You've swallowed a planet! You hit me with a cricket bat.

They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! Saving the world with meals on wheels.

You've swallowed a planet! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
